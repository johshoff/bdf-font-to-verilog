This is just a small project to convert the IBM BIOS font to a format readable
by Verilog.

The artifact, ib8x8u.bin, is provided, but putting the code out there in case
anyone (probably me) needs to convert another of these fonts.

Thanks to int10h for providing [the IBM BIOS font](https://int10h.org/oldschool-pc-fonts/fontlist/?1#ibm-bios),
to Farsil for providing [the BDF versions](https://github.com/farsil/ibmfonts/),
and tomchen for providing [a BDF parser for python](https://github.com/tomchen/bdfparser).
